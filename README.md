## README


 Made for Linux Debian Distributions (OS-Ubuntu)
 
 This script is for people like me, too many times I have input the same 5 update commands daily.
 
 What does this script do?
 - Updates package list | Prints complete text
 - Installs available package updates from list | Prints complete text
 - Updates available snap packages | Prints complete text
 - Cleans old packages and configurations | Prints complete text
 - Cleans old system packages | Prints complete text
 - Prints "Script Complete" when finished

 Each stage of the script is easily displayed in green to help view any changes made during updates and cleaned files.

#### NOTE:
THIS SCRIPT HAS A SHA256SUM VERIFICATION SYSTEM | 
THE SHA256 FILE IS PROVIDED ALTHOUGH IF CHANGES ARE MADE TO THIS FILE YOU WILL NEED TO CREATE A NEW SHA256SUM NAMED
"update.sh.sha256" IN ORDER TO RUN, OTHERWISE COMMENTING THE VERIFICATION IS AN OPTION BUT NOT RECOMMENDED.
